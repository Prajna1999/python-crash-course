In the heart of a forgotten jungle, where vines whispered secrets to the trees,
lived a curious hello. This hello had a peculiar love for meat,
though the jungle offered only a meager taste of it.

One humid afternoon, an explorer stumbled upon the hello,
and was astonished to learn of its fondness for meat.
Wanting to help, the explorer gently coaxed the hello
into an adventure far from home.

They traveled to the bustling city of Delhi, where meat
was abundant and the hello feasted joyfully for days.

But as the city lights twinkled each night, the hello
longed for the rustling leaves and the chorus of frogs.
Homesick and weary, it yearned for the wild it once knew.

Touched by its sorrow, the explorer returned the hello
to its jungle homeâ€”this time, with a grand stash of meat
and a promise to visit again.

And so, the hello lived happily, savoring each bite beneath the stars.

The End.
